# Internship Application Workflow Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented the complete internship application workflow as requested. This system manages the entire process from company posting internships to final hiring with proper contact detail protection and notification system.

## Complete Workflow

### 1. **Company Posts Internship**
- Company creates and posts internship opportunities
- Internships are automatically visible to interns on their dashboard
- **Status**: `Active`, `Draft`, or `Closed`

### 2. **Intern Views & Applies**
- Interns can browse available internships
- When they apply, application goes to company dashboard
- **Initial Status**: `Applied`

### 3. **Company Reviews Applications**
- Company can see applicant details INCLUDING education and experience
- **Contact details are HIDDEN** until offer is accepted
- **Available Actions**: 
  - Start Review Process (`Applied` â†’ `Under Review`)

### 4. **Company Reviews & Decides**
- After review, company can either:
  - **Send Offer Letter** (`Under Review` â†’ `Offered`)
  - **Reject Application** (`Under Review` â†’ `Rejected`)

### 5. **Offer Letter Process**
- When offer is sent, intern receives notification
- **Status**: `Offered`
- Company waits for intern response
- **Contact details STILL HIDDEN**

### 6. **Intern Responds to Offer**
- Intern can accept or reject the offer
- **If Accepted**: `Offered` â†’ `Offer Accepted`
- **If Rejected**: `Offered` â†’ `Offer Rejected`

### 7. **Final Confirmation**
- **ONLY after offer acceptance**, company can see contact details
- Company can then confirm hiring: `Offer Accepted` â†’ `Hired`
- **Contact details become visible** only at this stage

## Key Features Implemented

### ðŸ”’ **Contact Detail Protection**
- Email and phone numbers are hidden until offer acceptance
- Uses `canViewContactDetails` flag in applicant data
- Shows helpful message: "Contact details will be available after offer acceptance"

### ðŸ“¬ **Notification System**
- Real-time notifications for workflow events
- Different notification types:
  - `application_received` - When application moves to review
  - `offer_sent` - When offer letter is sent
  - `offer_response` - When intern responds to offer
  - `hire_confirmed` - When hiring is confirmed
- Auto-dismissing notifications with smooth animations

### ðŸŽ¯ **Workflow-Based UI**
- Status-specific action buttons
- Progressive disclosure of actions based on current status
- Visual timeline showing application progress
- Color-coded status indicators

### ðŸ“Š **Enhanced Timeline**
- Complete application journey tracking
- Timestamped workflow events
- Visual progress indicators
- Status-specific messaging

## Status Flow

```
Applied â†’ Under Review â†’ Offered â†’ Offer Accepted â†’ Hired
              â†“              â†“           â†“
           Rejected    Offer Rejected  (End)
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Updated Type Definitions**
```typescript
interface Applicant {
  // ... existing fields
  status: 'Applied' | 'Under Review' | 'Offered' | 'Offer Accepted' | 'Offer Rejected' | 'Hired' | 'Rejected';
  canViewContactDetails?: boolean;
  offerSentDate?: Date;
  offerResponseDate?: Date;
  offerLetter?: string;
}
```

### 2. **Notification System**
- `NotificationSystem` component with animations
- `useNotifications` hook for state management
- Automatic cleanup and dismissal

### 3. **Workflow Logic**
- Status-based action availability
- Automatic contact detail visibility management
- Timestamp tracking for workflow events

### 4. **Enhanced Modal System**
- Conditional contact detail display
- Status-specific action buttons
- Comprehensive timeline view
- Detailed applicant information on demand

## Mock Data Examples

### Sample Workflow States:
